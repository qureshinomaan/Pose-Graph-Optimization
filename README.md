# Pose-Graph-Optimization
Optimizing the 2D trajectory of a robot from scratch using the Levenberg-Marquardt method for non-linear least squares.

In a nutshell, this project is on Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) which is typically used in most of today's SLAM Backends. The project involves:

1. Theoretical Introduction: PGO theory and 1D SLAM solved example walkthrough (redirected to Notion pages for in-depth theory).
2. Scratch: PGO Implementation from scratch on simple dataset using tools for evaluation/visualization like `EVO`, `g2o viewer` etc.
3. Using graph optimization framework G2O: PGO using G2O library on multiple datasets using tools for evaluation/visualization like `EVO`, `g2o viewer` etc.
4. PGO related survey paper reading (Optional).
